# Daedalus Plataform

The former platform of my startup underwent a transformation, and we decided to embark on a new venture using Django and Next.js. However, I have preserved this former platform as an unfinished project, intended to showcase my skills and accomplishments.

For this endeavor, I embraced cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Harnessing the power of these tools, we incorporated robust features into this platform. To ensure seamless user experiences, we implemented Firebase for authentication and utilized Firestore as the database to manage intricate client details, including subscriptions and access to specific pages. As a testament to our commitment to excellence, we developed a meticulously crafted component that seamlessly handles these functionalities through an API interface.
